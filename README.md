## UX design

## problems

author issue

cursor issue . I decided to make it a list

In the Stats page I had to put front end (JS) and back end in comunication in order to send the use choice and check in the DB What was the highest rated book.
Initially I have tried to just use simple call my flask method again. This was definetely not a good idea and I finally undestood I had to make Ajax requests instead.
I solved the issue using Fetch API that allowed me to keep client and server side in comunication. In order to transfer the data I had to use JSON format and serialize/ parse methods in both languages.
